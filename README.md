# NFL-Player-Database-and-Fantasy-Football-Team-Creator
  The user can look at the player database which includes the players’ statistics and their real life team. The user will create a dream team where they choose the players that they want and add them to an imaginary team comprised of the players they selected. As stated earlier the game also has the real life statistics of each player so it’s smart for players to do heavy research on the statistics of the players that they select to their team to make the best team possible! Admins can modify the player database by adding players to the database, modifying player in-game statistics, the players ages, their real life team, etc. Admins can also add or delete users from the game.
